# AccountDB
Java application for testing account creation with SQLite DB

This is a test respository for me to practice using Java to interact with a locally stored database (SQLite)

I want to give users the ability to create an account and login to said account to then begin to play very basic games where they can
earn points which will be appointed to them uniquely, the user will be able to view their details and edit them if nescessary

As additonal functionality I will implement an admin page where I can do a wipe of the database or view all the user information,
in the future I would like to implement a restriction feature whereby only a few users can interact with the admin page, I would like to
do this by sending an email with a unique code attached to it

This is more of a personal project whereby I will move onto using MongoDB and MongoServer with JavaScript to increase my programming
abilities, I thought having a basic user interface with an embedded local database would be a good place to start
